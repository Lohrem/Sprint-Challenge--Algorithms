#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The bigger 'n' is, the longer it will take for the code to finish up because of the while loop. O(n^3)


b) Due to the second loop comparing values, the runtime complexity is O(n) since only the first loop is iterating.


c) This function is checking if bunnies exist, therefore the runtime complexity is O(1) since it is not iterating over anything.

## Exercise II
    The algorithm would need to find the last floor in which the end doesn't break and the first floor in which it does. O(log n)
